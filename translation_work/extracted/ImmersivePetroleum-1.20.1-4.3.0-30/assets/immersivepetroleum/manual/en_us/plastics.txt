<link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oPhenolic resin§r> is a chemical marvel for the modern age, but it was missing a petroleum derived process for its production.

Using newly developed thermal cracking systems, this is no longer the case: phenolic resin can be produced from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§onaphtha§r;naphtha> feedstock using a high temperature processing to crack it into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§opetroleum gas§r;petroleum_gas>.

The <link;immersivepetroleum:hydrotreater;§n§oHigh-Pressure Refinery Unit§r> is used to crack naphtha, converting 1500mB naphtha and 500mB of water to 2000mB of petroleum gas.

Petroleum Gas cannot be used to produce <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§ophenolic resin§r> directly as resin is a heavy polymer. The raw mixture must be processed into precursors for the resin in a <link;immersiveengineering:refinery;§n§oRefinery§r>.

Benzol is an aromatic mixture, and can be combined in the <link;immersiveengineering:refinery;§n§oRefinery§r> with petroleum gas to produce the phenol-containing mixture <link;cokeoven;creosote oil;outputs>.

Petroleum Gas can be oxidized to acetaldehyde using §2Constantan Plate§r as a catalyst.

These two chemical feedstocks are used to produce the polymer resin of <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oduroplast§r;duroplast_sheet>.
