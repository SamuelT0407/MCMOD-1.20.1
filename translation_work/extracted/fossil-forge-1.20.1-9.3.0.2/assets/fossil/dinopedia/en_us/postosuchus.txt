While the Late Triassic is famously heralded as the time of the rise of the dinosaurs, non-dinosaurian predators were still quite common and successful during the time. Postosuchus kirkpaticki, a species of rauisuchid archosaur, is one example of this. While it exhibited many traits familiar to other pseudosuchians such as osteoderms on its neck and back, it also mirrored the dinosaurs by likely being bipedal. The tropical environment of Late Triassic North America allowed Postosuchus to become one of the largest carnivorous reptiles of its time - over half as tall as the average person - with fine-tuned senses such as sight and smell.
