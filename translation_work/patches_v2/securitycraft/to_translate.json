  "help.securitycraft.incognito_mask.info": "[待翻译] The incognito mask is an item that can be used for testing the ownership mechanics of SecurityCraft blocks. If a player is wearing such a mask, blocks owned by that player will not recognize them as their owner anymore. This means that all of these blocks will behave as if a non-owner was interacting with them, and Allowlist and Denylist Modules listing the player will ignore them. If the mask is renamed in an anvil, all of the wearer's blocks and list modules will act as if the player whose name the mask has been renamed to is trying to use the block.",
